🚀 What We Look for in Startups at LvlUp Ventures 🚀
(From the investor’s perspective)

At LvlUp Ventures, we back Seed-stage startups that are bold enough to think differently—and scrappy enough to make it happen.

Here’s what stands out to us when reviewing new opportunities:

✅ Clear Problem & Unique Insight
Startups that truly understand the pain point they're solving and bring a fresh, founder-led perspective to the table.

✅ Early Signs of Traction
This doesn't have to be sky-high revenue—but strong signals like user retention, organic growth, partnerships or early sales channels working well.

✅ A Sharp, Coachable Team
We love founders who are relentless and receptive. You're the expert in your domain—but open to strategic collaboration.

✅ Capital Efficiency
We’re big believers in doing more with less. Efficient execution and thoughtful resource allocation go a long way in this market.

✅ Platform Potential
Can this product evolve into something bigger? We get excited by businesses with real ecosystem or category-defining potential.

Our team rolls up its sleeves post-investment—we don’t just write checks, we help you grow through partnerships, channel support, and deep founder-in-residence experience.

If you're building something bold, we’d love to hear from you.

The “friends & family” round is a myth for most founders 😲 

No one talks enough about how hard it is to raise at the Pre-Seed and Seed stage when:

You don’t come from Stanford or Harvard
You don’t have a wealthy network
Your deck isn’t getting replies
And your traction is "early... but promising"

Yet somehow, you're expected to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to build your MVP, grow your team, or just buy time to focus.

Here’s the truth: Fundraising at this stage isn’t just hard — it’s opaque, inefficient, and often biased toward founders with connections, not capability.

We're combating this at.

Our mission is simple: help great founders raise capital faster — not because of who they know, but because of what they’re building.

We work with 15+ funding partners who actively invest in Pre-Seed and Seed rounds. We don’t charge founders a dime. We make warm intros, host investor events, and even help refine your materials if needed.

If you’re raising — or thinking about it — apply to our network. One app = exposure to dozens of investors.

Founders keep telling me they’re “too early” for VCs 👀 

But more often than not, it’s not the stage that’s the problem — it’s the story.

Investors don’t need millions in revenue.
We need to believe you’re the one to build something big.

When Airbnb was pitching, most investors passed.
The idea sounded niche. Couch-surfing for conferences? Really?

But they reframed it:
“People are already doing this — they’re just doing it in untrustworthy, fragmented ways. We’re building the trusted platform.”

They showed a vision that was WAY bigger than a few air mattresses.
They made the early traction feel inevitable.
They made the pain point obvious.

Suddenly, the “too early” startup became a rocketship 🚀

Here’s the truth:
You’re not too early.
You just haven’t told a story that makes your future feel inevitable.

If you’re a founder in that zone, I want to hear your pitch.
Even if you only have 20 users.

👇 Apply Here (We Meet With Every Founder) 👇

Why is Ticket Tree different from every ticketing platform you've been on? 🎟️

We are a platform founded by fans, for fans. 🙌

- We've experienced the headaches of seeing fees as high as 40%, sometimes even 100%, at checkout.

- We've been scammed on primary ticketing sites!

- We've cherished every ticket stub as a memento, only to see them replaced by QR codes.

We are building a platform for everyone to access their dream events safely and affordably. Excited to finally announce beta launch coming 🔜

For info on being a beta tester, platform sneaks, and special ticket discounts, sign up for our weekly newsletter! 📰

Why haven't sports teams adopted loyalty programs for fans? 🤔

We know that 84% of consumers are more likely to stick with a brand that offers a loyalty program, yet teams rely on ineffective marketing and nostalgia to get fans back into the stadium. 🎟️🏟️

Tick3t Tree is taking this concept to the next level by not only offering an affordable ticketing option for fans but also providing them with post-event digital mementos and rewards from their favorite organizations. 🏆📱

As fan attendance begins to dwindle due to increasing prices, lack of value, and viewership competition between different sports, we're on a mission to give host organizations the tools to strengthen the bond with their beloved fans. 💪🏻

Last week we onboarded 100 users to the MNLY platform. Each step in the customer journey is now being battle tested in a live environment. 

The week was filed with a ton of unforeseen issues. However that's why we are running beta, to ensure these issues are ironed out before the public market can get their hands on our product.

Here's some takeaways from a week of behind the scenes chaos:

1. ALWAYS battle test your product before going live.

2. There will always be unforeseen issues.

3. Your ideal customer journey is defined by your customers.

4. Timelines are never exactly how you planned.

5. Customers never behave as you expect them to, so over communicate the process initially.

6. ALWAYS hire top down even as a start up. Find ways to acquire the talent you need from the start.

The journey has been grueling yet rewarding in every way. Without the struggle there would be no value in the process.

If you're new to the startup world. Keep going. Take the lessons and use that experience to drive your vision forward.

You only fail if you give up.

Deepfakes, an AI-powered technology that produces digitally altered images and videos which make one appear and sound like someone else — whether that be politicians, celebraties, or your friend — are on the rise.

Here are the issues that we need to focus on and prevent in my opinion -

1) Deepfakes becoming a large portion of the content online, causing widespread false information and decreasing the reliability of news everywhere.

2) The technology can lead to authoritarianism, as governments may decide to only allow state-run or approved media, for good or bad motives, due to deepfakes causing rampant disinformation about a variety of topics and then deciding that is the solution that they should implement.

3) Large Media companies — some of which are corrupt — vouching for only their content to be viewed with the goal of shrinking the size of smaller, but high-quality news sources and social media platforms where people view information and opinions. They may make a largely misleading argument like “the risk of deepfakes that exist in many of these places will sway public opinion based on false information.” If that happens, people’s access to a largely accurate set of information from a variety of viewpoints and all sides of the aisle will be tremendously decreased or become non-existent.

How do we stop these things from happening?

We need to develop a public-private partnership that consists of strong regulations against deepfakes and similar emerging threats, as a result of largely good technology like AI and deep learning, and create measures to stop them from ever being posted.
