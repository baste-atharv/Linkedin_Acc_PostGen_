(From the investor’s perspective)

At LvlUp Ventures, we back Seed-stage startups that are bold enough to think differently—and scrappy enough to make it happen.

Here’s what stands out to us when reviewing new opportunities:

✅ Clear Problem & Unique Insight
Startups that truly understand the pain point they're solving and bring a fresh, founder-led perspective to the table.

✅ Early Signs of Traction
This doesn't have to be sky-high revenue—but strong signals like user retention, organic growth, partnerships or early sales channels working well.

✅ A Sharp, Coachable Team
We love founders who are relentless and receptive. You're the expert in your domain—but open to strategic collaboration.

✅ Capital Efficiency
We’re big believers in doing more with less. Efficient execution and thoughtful resource allocation go a long way in this market.

✅ Platform Potential
Can this product evolve into something bigger? We get excited by businesses with real ecosystem or category-defining potential.

Our team rolls up its sleeves post-investment—we don’t just write checks, we help you grow through partnerships, channel support, and deep founder-in-residence experience.

If you're building something bold, we’d love to hear from you.

No one talks enough about how hard it is to raise at the Pre-Seed and Seed stage when:

You don’t come from Stanford or Harvard
You don’t have a wealthy network
Your deck isn’t getting replies
And your traction is ""early... but promising""

Yet somehow, you're expected to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to build your MVP, grow your team, or just buy time to focus.

Here’s the truth: Fundraising at this stage isn’t just hard — it’s opaque, inefficient, and often biased toward founders with connections, not capability.

We're combating this at.

Our mission is simple: help great founders raise capital faster — not because of who they know, but because of what they’re building.

We work with 15+ funding partners who actively invest in Pre-Seed and Seed rounds. We don’t charge founders a dime. We make warm intros, host investor events, and even help refine your materials if needed.

If you’re raising — or thinking about it — apply to our network. One app = exposure to dozens of investors.

 3 weeks ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn","Founders keep telling me they’re “too early” for VCs 👀 

But more often than not, it’s not the stage that’s the problem — it’s the story.

Investors don’t need millions in revenue.
We need to believe you’re the one to build something big.

When Airbnb was pitching, most investors passed.
The idea sounded niche. Couch-surfing for conferences? Really?

But they reframed it:
“People are already doing this — they’re just doing it in untrustworthy, fragmented ways. We’re building the trusted platform.”

They showed a vision that was WAY bigger than a few air mattresses.
They made the early traction feel inevitable.
They made the pain point obvious.

Suddenly, the “too early” startup became a rocketship 🚀

Here’s the truth:
You’re not too early.
You just haven’t told a story that makes your future feel inevitable.

If you’re a founder in that zone, I want to hear your pitch.
Even if you only have 20 users.

The week was filed with a ton of unforeseen issues. However that's why we are running beta, to ensure these issues are ironed out before the public market can get their hands on our product.

Here's some takeaways from a week of behind the scenes chaos:

1. ALWAYS battle test your product before going live.

2. There will always be unforeseen issues.

3. Your ideal customer journey is defined by your customers.

4. Timelines are never exactly how you planned.

5. Customers never behave as you expect them to, so over communicate the process initially.

6. ALWAYS hire top down even as a start up. Find ways to acquire the talent you need from the start.

The journey has been grueling yet rewarding in every way. Without the struggle there would be no value in the process.

If you're new to the startup world. Keep going. Take the lessons and use that experience to drive your vision forward.

You only fail if you give up.

👉 Introduction: The National Football League (NFL), long known for its on-field excellence, has also demonstrated a keen business acumen off the gridiron. One of the league's most intriguing off-field endeavors has been its foray into venture capital. This case study delves into the NFL's venture capital initiatives, exploring how the league has leveraged its brand, resources, and partnerships to score big in the world of
and
.

💼 Venture Capital Investments: The NFL, through its rather secretive venture arm 32 Equity, started making strategic investments in promising startups. These investments encompass various sectors within the sports and entertainment industry, from health and wellness tech to media and content delivery platforms. One notable investment is in, a leading sports merchandise retailer, which has become a unicorn. This investment allowed the NFL to tap into the rapidly growing e-commerce market while expanding its fan engagement capabilities.

🤝 Strategic Partnerships: Beyond direct investments, the NFL fostered strategic partnerships with tech giants like

. These partnerships not only enhanced the league's digital infrastructure but also helped develop cutting-edge solutions for in-game analytics, fan experiences, and content delivery. The NFL's partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS) resulted in the Next Gen Stats platform, which revolutionized how football data is collected and analyzed, providing fans with a deeper understanding of the game.

📺 Brand Synergy: The NFL leveraged its brand equity to attract startups seeking credibility and visibility. Entrepreneurs saw the NFL as a trusted partner that could help accelerate their growth by providing access to a vast and engaged fan base. This brand synergy created a win-win situation, as the NFL gained access to innovative technologies while startups received invaluable exposure and support.

Investments in startups have contributed to the league's growing digital presence and fan engagement, while partnerships with tech giants have enhanced the in-game experience for fans and players alike.

Conclusion: The NFL's
journey exemplifies how a traditional sports league can successfully navigate the startup landscape. By making strategic investments, forming key partnerships, and capitalizing on its brand strength, the

Here are the issues that we need to focus on and prevent in my opinion -

1) Deepfakes becoming a large portion of the content online, causing widespread false information and decreasing the reliability of news everywhere.

2) The technology can lead to authoritarianism, as governments may decide to only allow state-run or approved media, for good or bad motives, due to deepfakes causing rampant disinformation about a variety of topics and then deciding that is the solution that they should implement.

3) Large Media companies — some of which are corrupt — vouching for only their content to be viewed with the goal of shrinking the size of smaller, but high-quality news sources and social media platforms where people view information and opinions. They may make a largely misleading argument like “the risk of deepfakes that exist in many of these places will sway public opinion based on false information.” If that happens, people’s access to a largely accurate set of information from a variety of viewpoints and all sides of the aisle will be tremendously decreased or become non-existent.

How do we stop these things from happening?

We need to develop a public-private partnership that consists of strong regulations against deepfakes and similar emerging threats, as a result of largely good technology like AI and deep learning, and create measures to stop them from ever being posted.
